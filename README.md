# ProBuilder
A Super Fast Protein Backbone Generation Package

Probuilder is designed to generate protein backbone structure with predefined requirements, like folding, small molecule interaction, protein binding and ion binding. All the calculations are based solely on backbone coordinates and geometric constrains, so it is lightningly fast.


To build the apps:

    $ mkdir build & cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make -j 10
